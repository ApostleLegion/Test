With this players can use any Favor on any downtime they wish. The "Out of Category Bonus" only applies if a player uses a Favor of a certain Category for a Downtime it does not gain befits on.
Only one Favor may be used on any one Downtime. This bonus to rolls made stays until the downtime is completed and only works in downtime senarios. 

In addition players may now buy additional things with their Favors they gained. The added "items" will be noted below:
Item | Effect
:--: | :--:
Guild Backing | In order to create a guild a player must gain a "Guild Backing" from three Categories: Those three being Work, Monetary, and Reputation. The Class of the Favor must be at least Middle in order to redeem a "Guild Backing".
Reputation Points | These points give players additional rewards for their categories and may allow more advanced downtimes to be done.
Special Jobs | These are the "Art Show", "Special Job", "Heist", and "Research Expidition" redeemable items. Each of these allow a player to do a "quest" but also takes two downtimes to complete. A DM can pick up these quests at their own leisure. 

Special Jobs:
- Art Show: In this a player may create an art show, showing of their gems, and art they have collected. During this art show NPCs will try to steal art from the show and get it out before the player can catch them. As a reward the player gets as much gold value as they put in the art show without having to actually sell the items.
- Special Job: This is a Hitman's job or a crews job. The person that initiated this job will get to choose a target to try to assassinate or capture. This target can be any NPC a DM has ran before and must only be an NPC. As a reward a player gets 3x the reward amount for bounty hunts done for the next 5 bounty hunts.
- Hiest: Straight forward a player or crew are trying to infultrate an area and get coin and other items out. Player reward varies. 
- Research Expidition: Players can form an expidition group that goes and find the materials for three recipes of their choosing. On this Expidition if sucessful the player will gain enough crafting material to make at least one of the three items.
- More to come!
